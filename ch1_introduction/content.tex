\section{The cell}
The cell is the smallest unit of life, of which all known living organisms are composed. Every cell houses a plethora of biomolecular processes that allow it to adapt to changes in its environment continuously. It can be very challenging to comprehend the cellular response to a signal due to the dynamic nature of these processes. A reductionist approach to understanding a complex biological system is to study the biochemical components which it is comprised of \cite{brigandt_reductionismbiology_2017}.

Recent advances in experimental technologies are playing a crucial role in reductionist biology, allowing to measure the abundance of thousands of different biochemical molecules in tens of thousands of individual cells. Observing the biomolecular insides of cells in this manner can ultimately provide fundamental insights into the processes that govern these cells and help uncover novel approaches for diagnosing and treating disease. Every coin has its flip side, however, and in this case, it is that the amount of data generated from these experiments is not analysable by hand.  

For example, the Human Cell Atlas (HCA) consortium \cite{regev_humancellatlas_2018} has set out to develop a comprehensive reference map of all the different types of cells in the human body. Experts in the field often metaphorically describe the HCA initiative as aiming to develop a 'Google Maps' of the human body. Even in its infancy, the HCA has profiled 3.8 million cells from 248 donors across 42 labs \cite{humancellatlasconsortium_humancellatlas_2018}, and this number is likely to increase well above one hundred million.

%%%% HT: I feel like you're only going to focus on preprocessing, when reading this section. Maybe add a second paragraph mentioning that separating technical and biological noise from actual biological processes in the data is not the only challenge, and that there is also a necessity of new computational tools to start generating more complex models, integrating the information from single cell high sequencing experiments in a much more refined way?
%%% RC: In general, these two paragraphs are not telling the reader a lot about where this thesis is going

The sheer volume of the data generated from such highly-integrative and high-throughput experiments are not the only reason why they are so challenging to interpret. 
Namely, the data contains high levels of noise arising from inherent biomolecular stochasticity in the cells and from the experimental profiling techniques uses, as well as batch effects arising from differences between donors and labs \cite{hon_humancellatlas_2018}. Biologists thus turn to computer scientists\footnote{or computational biologists turn to themselves} to develop new tools to tackle these problems and help biologists extract meaningful biological insights from the data.

This work makes incremental contributions to the field in order to be able to address the aforementioned problems in a more comprehensive context. This chapter first introduces several key concepts in both cell biology and computer science, upon which the remainder of this work relies. Afterwards, the research objectives and main contributions of this work are outlined.
% TODO: explain that only the main concepts are introduced?

\subsection{The origins of life and the RNA world}
The discovery of the double helix shape of Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) \cite{watson_molecularstructurenucleic_1953} is often considered the pivot point in our understanding of the origins of life and evolution. By now, it is well known that DNA serves as a medium for storing the genetic information required to reproduce a whole organism. With other words, the DNA of an organism contains the complete set of instructions required to build all of the biomolecular machinery present in its body.
The magnitude of this discovery is reflected in our language and culture alike; with sayings such as "It's in your DNA.", or usage of its shape in countless illustrations or artworks (Figure \ref{fig:fsvm}).
%% HT: I'm not sure if the magnitude of the DNA discovery is best reflected in sayings and double helix monuments it sounds a bit light to me, compared to the fact that you can identify geneticel targets of a disease and Crispr cas it for instance, but that's a personal opinion, feel free to ignore it :)

Even so, a widely-accepted hypothesis states that life (or cells) did not originate from DNA, but instead was kicked off from its lesser-known cousin, Ribonucleic Acid (RNA). According to the RNA world hypothesis \cite{alberts_rnaworldorigins_2002}, the very first primitive cells used RNA both to store genetic information and perform the chemical reactions required to sustain themselves (Figure \ref{fig:rnaworld}). Only later did cells develop the ability to use DNA and proteins to self-sustain in a process commonly referred to as the Central Dogma.

\end{figure}

\subsection{The Central Dogma}
The Central Dogma is a set of processes present which govern the general flow of genetic information in almost all existent living cells. In short, it states that DNA codes for RNA, which in turn codes for proteins.
In this work, we assume the main processes involved in the Central Dogma are replication, transcription, splicing and translation (Figure 3). 

%% TODO: add figure

\textbf{Replication} is the process of duplicating DNA, which allows a cell to divide such that the resulting daughter cells retain complete copies of its genetic information. DNA consists of four different so-called nucleobases named adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and thymine (T). Each strand of the double helix structure of DNA is a linear chain of nucleobases. The two strands are held together by hydrogen bonds since adenine can form three hydrogen bonds with thymine and cytosine can form two hydrogen bonds with guanine. Each nucleobase can only bond with one other nucleobase, making the strands complementary to one another. 
Since one strand can be deduced from its complementary strand, DNA can be represented by a sequence of letters, for example, "ACTCGGTTTAGCA". 

A stretch of DNA that contains a genetic blueprint for a particular molecule is called a gene, and the collection of an organism's genes is called its genome. \textbf{Transcription} is the process of synthesising an RNA molecule from a gene, and the resulting molecule is called a transcript. RNA is similar to DNA but differs in several ways; most notably all thymine nucleobases are replaced with uracil (U), and RNA molecules consist of only one strand.
% HT: , which is able to exit the nucleus compartment.
% RC: I haven't introduced the concept of a nucleus yet
Due to its single-strandedness, RNA is less stable and will break down faster. Single-strandedness also allows some types of RNA (e.g. transfer RNA, ribosomal RNA) to form more complex three-dimensional structures by having certain regions bind to other regions of the strand. This work only considers messenger RNA (mRNA), which are transcribed from protein-coding genes, meaning that the mRNAs can result in the production of particular proteins. A protein-coding gene consists of alternating sections called introns and exons. Exonic regions contain code for what a protein should be made up of, whereas the intronic regions can contain information on how to assemble the pieces.
% TODO: mention that there are about 20'000 protein-coding genes in the human body.

\textbf{RNA splicing} is a process that occurs in almost all organisms and results in the removal of intronic regions in the mRNA molecules, resulting in a mature mRNA. 
Splicing allows to create multiple variants of the same product, which can affect the enzymatic properties or localisation of the resulting product \cite{kelemen_functionalternativesplicing_2013}.

During \textbf{translation}, a chain of amino acids is synthesised from a mature mRNA transcript. 
% HT: in ribosomes. These units can be seen as small factories in which amino acids are assembled following the pattern contained in an mRNA molecule.
% RC: I can avoid talking about ribosomes
Every three nucleobases are translated into one of 21 different amino acids. The resulting chain of amino acids is folded up into a protein, the structure of which is determined by the sequence of different amino acids in the chain. In turn, its structure determines the functionality of the protein, which includes catalysing biochemical reactions, providing structure, and transportation of molecules. 

\subsection{Cell types}
The functionality provided by a cell is defined (mostly) by the proteins of which it consists. One common approach to trying to understand the functionality of a cell is to observe which molecules are present in the cell and to associate those molecules with functionality. 

\textit{Homo sapiens} like to categorise everything they encounter and so too have they conceptualised groups of cells called "cell types" according to their functionality. The concept of cell types eases reasoning about all aspects of biology, for instance, which cell types turn into (differentiate) or communicate with which other cell types, or how a cell type responds to a specific stimulation. Cells can be highly specialised toward performing a particular function (e.g. memory B cells accelerate immune response by remembering previously encountered pathogens), or they can maintain a strong ability to differentiate into other cell types. 

% TODO: do not only discuss differentiation, but instead any kind of developmental process; and mention 'developmental trajectory'.
Cell differentiation is not an instant process; it is a continuous process in which a cell gradually produces the biochemical machinery required in order to fulfil a particular task. In this regard, it makes sense not only to reason about cell types but also about the transition states between cell types and the dynamic processes involved therein.
% TODO: are dynamic processes defined? a dynamic process is just a biochemical reaction

\subsection{Cell dynamics and gene regulation}
If cells are dynamic entities and can gradually produce the molecules needed to acquire new functionality, what is the process by which this happens? The mechanism by which this happens is called gene regulation. Some proteins (or other molecules such as micro RNAs) are capable of determining the rate at which a gene is transcribed (transcription rate). Such proteins are called transcription factors (TFs), and the genes they regulate are called their targets. Typically, one TF will regulate the transcription rate of many targets. % TODO: download database and calculate some statistics.

Production of a specific molecule might require multiple cascades of gene regulation. The collection of all gene regulatory interactions between transcription factors and targets is called a gene regulatory network (GRN). Studying the active parts of a cell's gene regulatory network can thus reveal which dynamic processes are taking place. 

% TODO: explain regulation mechanisms such as transcription factor binding sites?
\subsection{Profiling single cells}
In order to understand a biological process, it is often quite helpful to be able to profile (i.e. observe) the biomolecular components involved therein. The single-cell "omics" technologies which we have at our fingertips today originated from the convergence of two different fields, \emph{"single-cell"} and \emph{"omics"}.

The earliest approaches for measuring the abundance of particular molecules in \emph{single cells} used the preferred instrument of every stereotypical biologist: the microscope.
% HT: I wouldn't write that if it was my thesis, but then again, maybe it's only my personal choice
Since it was developed by Coons et al. in 1941, immunohistochemistry (IHC) has been instrumental in visualising antigen-antibody proteins \cite{coons_immunologicalpropertiesantibody_1941}. In many multicellular organisms, antibodies and antigens serve as crucial communication tools as part of the organism's immune system. A cell can present a particular type of antigen on its cell surface, which allows a particular type of antibody to bind to it.

IHC (and many other biotechnologies) visualises antigen-antibody reactions by attaching particular molecules to the antibody, such as an enzyme that catalyses a colour-producing reaction, or a fluorescent chemical compound that can re-emit light upon light excitation. Using different colours (wavelengths) allows measuring expression levels of different antibodies simultaneously. Characterising cells in a quantifiable way is labour intensive; however, since it involves acquiring an image of many cells and drawing a contour around each cell (called cell segmentation). While modern implementations of IHC improve the throughput drastically by using robots to automate the image acquisition and computer software to automate cell segmentation, the procedure is still labour intensive as the robots and computer software still needs to be kept in check.

Flow cytometry \cite{fulwyler_electronicseparationbiological_1965} is a technique which circumvents imaging and segmentation issues by having a steady stream of cells run through a laser and measuring the amount of light scattered from those cells. Flow cytometry technology enables to measure protein expression levels for millions of cells and tens of different antibodies. 

Since IHC and flow cytometry, many new technologies have been developed which allow quantifying expression levels of molecules in single cells (e.g. mass cytometry, single-cell qPCR, FISH). All of these single-cell (non-omics) technologies are limited by the number of different molecules they could measure, however; and thus required handpicking the molecules of interest before performing an experiment, making the experiment biased towards the preconceptions of the experimenter.

% HT: Is the section above needed? I felt like this 1.1.5 section was quite hard to read compared to the light previous sections.

On the other side of the spectrum are the so-called "omics" technologies. "Omics"\footnote{The etymology of "omics" is quite interesting \cite{yadav_wholenesssuffixomics_2007}.} is a collective term for profiling all molecules of a particular type in a high-throughput manner. There are many types of "omics", but the most commonly used are the following. In genomics, all of an organism's genes are studied -- its whole genome. Transcriptomics and proteomics study the organisms RNA transcripts and proteins, respectively. A notable downside of traditional omics technologies is that in order to capture enough material an ensemble of cells needs to be profiled, and thus only the average expression levels are returned; thereby granting the technology the name "bulk" omics. If a subset of these cells contains unique patterns in expression levels, this pattern will be masked in the bulk population and is thus undetectable. Specific examples of omics technologies are next-generation sequencing, which can be used to determine the DNA sequence of an organism, and RNA sequencing, which profiles the sequences of RNA transcripts. By mapping the sequences of RNA transcripts to genes in the organisms DNA, a gene expression profile can be obtained.
% Demonstrate the masking effect of bulk analyses.

Transformative technological advances in microvolume sequencing allowed Tang et al. to analyse the transcriptome at single-cell resolution \cite{tang_mrnaseqwholetranscriptomeanalysis_2009}, thereby bringing single-cell biology and omics together to create single-cell omics (Figure \ref{fig:profiling_convergence}A). During the decade that followed, the number of single-cell omics technologies has skyrocketed, allowing to profile tens of thousands of cells (Figure \ref{fig:profiling_convergence}B) and measuring other levels of information such as proteomic expression levels (Figure \ref{fig:profiling_convergence}C).

The rapidly advancing field of single-cell omics harbours exceptional opportunities to discover new aspects of biology and redefine existing knowledge. Some of these opportunities lie in efforts like the Human Cell Atlas. The HCA consortium has set out to redefine all human cell types in terms of their gene expression and location, and the developmental trajectories connecting the different cell types. As part of this endeavour, the consortium will likely profile the whole transcriptomes tens or even hundreds of millions of cells. 

\section{Computational tools}
The rapidly advancing field of single-cell omics harbours exceptional opportunities to discover new aspects of biology and redefine existing knowledge. 

Some of these opportunities lie in efforts such as the Human Cell Atlas. The HCA consortium has set out to redefine all human cell types in terms of their gene expression and location, and the developmental trajectories which connect the different cell types. As part of this endeavour, the consortium will perform single-cell omics on tens or even hundreds of millions of cells.

Single-cell omics permits new types of analyse but also come with hitherto unseen data characteristics, the combination of which poses exciting new challenges for the computational community to tackle (Figure \ref{fig:comp_tools}A)\cite{stegle_computationalanalyticalchallenges_2015,yuan_challengesemergingdirections_2017,chen_singlecellrnaseqtechnologies_2019}. These challenges include:
\begin{itemize}
	\item normalisation: separating biological noise from technical noise,
	\item dimensionality reduction: providing a visual and informative overview of a given dataset, 
	\item trajectory inference: identifying and characterising transitions between different cellular states, and
	\item gene regulatory network inference: inferring regulatory interactions between transcription factors across individual cells.
\end{itemize}

% TODO: provide better connection to the subsections below

\subsection{Normalisation}
% TODO: need to write still

\subsection{Dimensionality reduction}
Single-cell omics datasets typically have too many dimensions (features) in order to be easily interpretable by humans and even by most computational tools. 
Dimensionality reduction (DR) methods transform high-dimensional data into a meaningful representation with fewer dimensions. It is important to note that its usage depends on the target audience: for humans -- to visualise data in a 2-D plane to aid with interpretation by humans, or for computers -- to construct a denser representation of the data such that it mostly contains the same information but with fewer dimensions.

There are many ways of classifying DR methods \cite{engel_surveydimensionreduction_2012}, but this work will use the following main categories: feature projection-based and manifold learning. 
Projection-based DR methods aim to perform a linear transformation of the data while preserving the pairwise distances between samples as much as possible. Examples of commonly used projection-based DR methods in single-cell omics are PCA and MDS. 
Manifold learning methods are methods which reconstruct a higher-order structure in the original space (e.g. a graph or a grid), visualising the structure in a lower-dimensional space, and mapping the original samples to the lower-dimensional space. Manifold learning can be an iterative optimisation process using a predefined criterion. Examples of manifold learning techniques are t-SNE, Diffusion Maps and UMAP. 
% section is not very interestingly written

\subsection{Trajectory inference}
Single-cell omics data provide new opportunities for studying cellular dynamic processes, such as the cell cycle, cell differentiation and cell activation \cite{tanay_scalingsinglecellgenomics_2017,etzrodt_quantitativesinglecellapproaches_2014}. 
Trajectory inference (TI) is a new category of computational tools used to offer an unbiased and transcriptome-wide understanding of a dynamic process \cite{tanay_scalingsinglecellgenomics_2017,cannoodt_computationalmethodstrajectory_2016}. 

The dataset can be a single snapshot of a mixture of cells in different stages, or a set of samples collected at different time points (Figure \ref{fig:trajectory_inference}A). Typically, TI methods first analyse similarities between cells, optionally infer the topology of the underlying process, and finally order cells along that trajectory (Figure \ref{fig:trajectory_inference}B). The second step can be optional, as some methods assume a specific topology beforehand.
TI methods allow the identification of new subsets of cells, delineation of a differentiation tree, and characterisation of the main driver genes along a state transition (Figure \ref{fig:trajectory_inference}C). Current applications of TI focus on specific subsets of cells, but ongoing efforts to construct transcriptomic catalogs of whole organisms \cite{regev_humancellatlas_2017,han_mappingmousecell_2018,schaum_singlecelltranscriptomics20_2018} underline the urgency for accurate, scalable \cite{aibar_scenicsinglecellregulatory_2017,angerer_singlecellsmake_2017} and user-friendly TI methods.

	\label{fig:trajectory_inference}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Gene regulatory network inference}
Gene regulatory network inference, or network inference (NI) for short, is a type of computational analysis where thousands of transcriptomic profiles are analysed together in order to infer the regulatory interactions between transcription factors and genes. This topic already received much attention with the advent of bulk omics (before single-cell omics). These efforts culminated in several DREAM competitions assessing the performance of 29 different NI methods \cite{marbach_revealingstrengthsweaknesses_2010, marbach_wisdomcrowdsrobust_2012}. 

After the last DREAM competition, it seemed that interest in NI methodology had declined. After all, NI on bulk omics profiles suffered from several crucial issues. As mentioned previously, bulk profiles are generated by pooling together the RNA transcripts of a supposedly homogeneous population of thousands of cells. Since the expression values are averaged over the whole population, incorrect assumptions on the homogeneity of the pooled cells may lead to the masking of relevant expression patterns in rare cell populations (Figure \ref{fig:bulk_vs_singlecell}). Besides, NI methods rely on a diverse set of time-series and perturbation experiments in order to reliably identify causal regulatory interactions. Such experiments are expensive and time-consuming, and an inaccurate selection of time points might result in crucial intermediate stages being missed.

\begin{figure}[htb!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\Largefigure]{fig/ni_bulk_vs_sc}
	\caption{Bulk expression data return the average expressions of genes among large numbers of cells. In order to infer regulatory networks from this type of data, multiple bulk profiles (resulting from time series or perturbation experiments) are required. On the other hand, sequencing the transcriptome at the single-cell level uncovers the high variability among cells, providing the necessary information to infer gene regulatory networks directly.} % TODO: update label
	\label{fig:bulk_vs_singlecell}
\end{figure}

The advent of single-cell omics has made scientists wonder whether now is the time to revisit network inference \cite{stegle_computationalanalyticalchallenges_2015}. 
One of the main advantages of single-cell omics is the ability to quantify the exact cellular state of thousands of cells per experiment. The heterogeneity between cells caused by naturally occurring biological randomness \cite{padovan-merhar_usingvariabilitygene_2013} can be exploited to infer regulatory interactions between TFs and their target genes at much lower costs (see Figure \ref{fig:bulk_vs_singlecell}).
In this setting, heterogeneity in the cell population eases network inference, rather than mask condition-specific expression patterns in regulatory interactions.

\section{Research objectives}

Recent technological advancements in profiling single cells are having significant repercussions in many fields of biology. The new types of analyses made possible warrant the development of computational tools which can solve the problem at hand and deal with the new data characteristics, ultimately in order to create useful and accurate hypotheses for biologists.

In response, scientists all over the globe have been working hard to tackle these computational challenges, resulting in more than 470 software tools for processing single-cell omics data in one form or another \cite{zappia_exploringsinglecellrnaseq_2018}. More than half of these tools were published in peer-reviewed journals. 

The high number of tools available presents the user choice, but also uncertainty and indecision about which tool to use for the task at hand. Choosing the method with most citations might result in a weaker result than picking a method at random, and making an informed decision requires spending an enormous amount of time in comparing the results of numerous methods, on various platforms, on multiple different datasets. 

The field of single-cell omics needs quantitative ways to measure the performance of different categories of tools. Clear quantitative metrics allow performing comprehensive studies to assess the advantages and disadvantages of existing tools. In addition, they could also serve as a minimum performance criterion before the publication of a new tool.

In the computational jungle of single-cell omics, experts act as beacons of hope by sharing guidelines based on comprehensive benchmarking studies. Their disseminations (in the form of manuscripts \cite{lafzi_tutorialguidelinesexperimental_2018,luecken_currentbestpractices_2019}, courses \cite{kiselev_analysissinglecell_2019,martens_analysissinglecell_2019}, and slides shown during keynote caffeine refuelling sessions \cite{hemberg_coffeebreakanalysis_2019}) are crucial in leading new users, and ultimately the whole field, to better practices for performing single-cell omics analyses.

\section{Outline} % include contributions?
% mention focus on datasets which contain developing cells.

This work aims to tackle multiple computational problems in extracting biological hypotheses from single-cell omics data. (TODO: rephrase that we focus on datasets that contain developing cells, and that the tools we develop make this assumption.)
We introduce a framework for evaluating multiple types of single-cell omics tools, more specifically dimensionality reduction, trajectory inference, and gene regulatory network inference (Chapter \ref{chap:dyngen}). Next, we perform a comprehensive evaluation of 45 TI methods and construct guidelines based on our observations (Chapter \ref{chap:dynbenchmark}). As part of the evaluation, we developed a framework to infer, visualise, and interpret trajectories, which we made available as a separate tool called dyno (Chapter \ref{chap:dyno}).
We also introduce two new computational tools of our own. SCORPIUS is a TI method specialised in inferring linear trajectories (Chapter \ref{chap:scorpius}). bred is a true single-cell NI method which can infer gene regulatory networks for individual cells (Chapter \ref{chap:bred}).

Packages that were created as part of this work are hosted on Github under the username rcannood\footnote{\url{https://github.com/rcannood?tab=repositories}} or the dynverse organisation\footnote{\url{https://github.com/dynverse?tab=repositories}}. As part of our standard development practices, we automate execution of unit tests and writing extensive documentation to ensure the code complies with CRAN policy before submission. We aim to submit all other packages to CRAN as well.

We also helped maintain or extend other packages on Github, CRAN or Bioconductor on which our software depends. This includes help speed up parts of the dependency (slingshot), adding new functionality (devtools, ParamHelpers), fixing bugs (proxyC, rlang, monocle, splatter, slingshot), becoming a maintainer of orphaned packages (princurve, GillespieSSA), and extending the documentation (devtools, mlr, remotes). Several of these package receive millions of downloads per year (devtools, remotes, rlang).
