\section{Introduction}
% single cell transcriptomics,
% allows to computationally reconstruct cellular processes, which can be linear or branching or more complex -- e.g. differentiation
% capturing a birds eye view of a certain process is often crucial
% a high resolution view of a particular linear transition equally important
% to ensure no confounding effects distract from what you're trying to study

% relate to time series? 

% what about... supervised?
